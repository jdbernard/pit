FileProject.delete() does not handle sub-projects correctly.
============================================================

FileProject.delete() deletes the project directory if the directory is empty,
but fails to do so if the directory is not empty.

Initial Recommendation
----------------------

Loop through the issues and delete the files, loop through the projects and
call Project.delete(). Alternatively, use File.deleteDir() rather than
File.delete()
