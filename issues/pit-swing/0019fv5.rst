Add the ability to change the Issue text size.
==============================================

Description
-----------

It would be good to be able to choose the size of the text for issue display.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

This is a shared value between all project panels, so this needs to be on the
enclosing PIT mvc, not the individual *ProjectPanel* mvcs. The ideal
implementation is to bind the ``issueDetailTextArea.font`` property from the
*ProjectPanel* view to the main mvc ``model.issueDetailFont``, but this fails
and I cannot determine why. 

Solution
--------

The ``ProjectPanelController.displayIssue`` method checks the value of
``issueDetailTextArea.font`` against the main mvc ``model.issueDetailFont`` and
updates it if it differs before actually displaying the issue selected.
