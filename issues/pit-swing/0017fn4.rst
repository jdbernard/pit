Add the ability to load multiple project roots simultaneously.
==============================================================

Description
-----------

I often need to switch between different issue repositories (project-specific,
main work repo, etc.) and have to close the current repo and open a new one.
I would like to be able to keep multiple repositories open at the same time.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The interface should use tabbed panes to represent the different project roots.
The main view will need to split into seperate MVC components. This may simplify
the initial configuration, as the view data structures for the lists will no
longer be initialized at application startup.

Solution
--------

TBD
