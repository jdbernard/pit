New 'Bugs' created are not correctly categorized.
=================================================

Description
-----------

If the user clicks *New Issue* and does not manually select *Bug* from the drop-down
list, but instead leaves the default *Bug* selected, the actual issue bypasses the
template generation phase and gets its category defaulted to *Task*.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

It looks like this is related to the default value of the category list in the 
*New Task* dialog.

How was the bug fixed?
